            Rum ham is one of our more traditional recipes perfected by Chief Frank. The following is an excerpt from the book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Always-Sunny-Philadelphia-Awakening/dp/0062225111/ref=asc_df_0062225111/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=266060734220&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13548849341457155782&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052671&hvtargid=pla-435476774808&psc=1">"The 7 Secrets of Awakening the Highly Effective Four-Hour Giant".</em></a>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 10-pound canned ham</li>
            <li>1 hunting knife</li>
            <li>3 1-liter bottles of rum</li>
            <li>1 handgun</li>
            <li>1 box handgun ammo</li>
            <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>De-can ham (for instructions, see back of can).</li>
            <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
            <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
            <li>Load gun.</li>
            <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.
                Remove safety from handgun.</li>
            <li>Wait for ham pirates.</li>
            <li>Shoot ham pirates.</li>
            <li>Reload gun.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li></ol>
